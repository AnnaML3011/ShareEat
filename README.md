## Description
ShareEat is a recipe sharing app where people can share their recipes and ideas. \
Android app developed in Java using Android studio. \
The idea is to convert physical cookbooks to an a convenient, organized platform where you can follow your recipes by categories, save the recipes you like, etc. \
I used Firebase services such as: 
* Authentication
* Cloud Firestore
* Storage

## How it works
At the first time, you should create an account and fill your details. \
Then, after creating the account you will enter the main page. \
At this page you can find recent recipes, your wish list which is empty at the beginning, \
an option to upload your profile image, and upload a new recipe.

To upload a new recipe you need to click the plus button at the bottom. \
Choose recipe category, fill the recipe details, put an image of the recipe and upload your recipe.

You can also edit your recipes by clicking the pen at the right side of the recipe. 




Also you have At the menu button option to see your recipes which you uploaded, recipes that you like, \
and see all the recipes of all the users arranged in categories. 


You can add and remove recipes to/from your Wish List by clicking on 'heart' sign.
