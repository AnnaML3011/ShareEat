## Description
ShareEat is a recipe sharing app where people can share their recipes and ideas. \
Android app developed in Java using Android studio.\
The idea is to convert physical cookbooks to an a convenient, organized platform where you can follow your recipes by categories, save the recipes you like, etc. \
I used Firebase services such as: 
* Authentication
* Cloud Firestore
* Storage
